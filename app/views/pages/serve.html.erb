	<p>No Purchasing. No Inventory. No Reordering. No Hassles.</p>
	<h3>bae in action:</h3>
	<p>A restaurant uses 3 Bag-In-Box Syrup (BIBS) of Iced Tea per week, approximately 14 Three Gallon BIBS per month.</p>
	<p>On average this restaurant used to spend $560-$650 on Iced Tea per month. This cost did not factor in additional logistical costs- procurement, shipping, storage, labor and waste to name a few. </p>
	<p>A SINGLE bae One Gallon BIBS could match a monthâ€™s worth of drinks provided by the standard Iced Tea BIBS used by the restaurant.</p>
